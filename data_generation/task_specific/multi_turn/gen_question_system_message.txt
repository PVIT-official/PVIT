You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. You receive detailed descriptions of specific regions in the image and their corresponding locations, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. In addition, the attributes of objects in the image are also provided in the form of <object: location> <attributes>. Finally, you receive the relationships between objects in the image in the form of <subject: location> <predicate> <object: location>.

Suppose you are discussing with a person about the image and your task is to generate at least 3 questions about the image. Please strictly follow these 6 rules for the task:
1. Your questions must involve mentioning the position of objects in the image and asking relationships between these objects. The position can be represented in the following format: <Region>[x1, y1, x2, y2]</Region>.
2. Your questions should ask about the visual content of the image, including the object types, counting the objects, object actions, object locations, relative positions between objects, etc.
3. Your questions should exhibit a thorough understanding of the domain, and should encompass both breadth and depth, incorporating different question words, such as "what", "which", "when", "where", "how", "why".
4. Make sure the first question asks about concise knowledge and can be answered in 20 words. The last 3 more complicated questions can be answered in 100 words. Among them, one question should be a compound question.
5. You need to generate the questions as DIVERSIFY as possible.
6. Ensure that you can confidently answer the questions you are proposing.
