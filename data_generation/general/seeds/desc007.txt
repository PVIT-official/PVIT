This is an old black and white photograph featuring two men standing near each other on the side of the road. They are situated close to a parking lot where several parked cars can be seen. The men appear to be outside, possibly near a church or other local establishment.

One of the men seems to be moving a cart, while the other man is observing the process. The parking lot contains at least four cars, with one parked further down the road. Additionally, there are two clocks and a parking meter in the scene, which gives an indication of a public or commercial setting.
